A Javascript side-by-side viewer for texts. Adapted from
http://www.assembla.com/spaces/jdualtextviewer/, by Geoffroy Noel.

The texts to be compared are fetched via AJAX calls; they are expected
to be HTML containing two elements with the ids "text-toc" and
"text-content".

See the example files for how the viewer might be used.
