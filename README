A Javascript side-by-side viewer for texts. Adapted from
http://www.assembla.com/spaces/jdualtextviewer/, by Geoffroy Noel.

The viewer takes two texts in a set of related texts and displays them
side by side. If there are more than two texts in the set, there is UI
for each text to be changed to another.

The viewer can provide synchronisation between the two texts, so that
as one text is scrolled through, the other keeps pace. This requires
the "matchIds" function to be modified to provide the id in the other
text that corresponds with the id in the scrolled text.

Jump functionality is also possible, whereby the user enters a label
for one of the texts and the viewing pane jumps to that point in the
text. This requires that the functions "getIdFromLabel" and
"getLabelFromId" be implemented.
